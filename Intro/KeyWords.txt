Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). These keywords are part of the Python language and are used to define the syntax and structure of the code. Here is a list of Python keywords:

```python
and       as        assert    async     await
break     class     continue  def       del
elif      else      except    False     finally
for       from      global    if        import
in        is        lambda    None      nonlocal
not       or        pass      raise     return
True      try       while     with      yield
```

These keywords are case-sensitive, so using lowercase or uppercase letters affects their interpretation. It's important not to use keywords as variable names to avoid conflicts and ensure the proper functioning of the code.

For example, the following code would result in a syntax error because `if` is a keyword:

```python
if = 10  # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Avoid using these keywords as identifiers to prevent confusion and ensure code readability.
