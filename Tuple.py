# Tuples in Python are similar to Python lists but not entirely. Tuples are immutable and ordered and allow duplicate values. Some Characteristics of Tuples in Python.

# We can find items in a tuple since finding any item does not make changes in the tuple.
# One cannot add items to a tuple once it is created. 
# Tuples cannot be appended or extended.
# We cannot remove items from a tuple once it is created. 

# Python tuples are ordered and we can access their elements using their index values. They are also immutable, i.e., we cannot add, remove and change the elements once declared in the tuple, so when we tried to add an element at index 1, it generated the error.print("Value in Var[-3] = ", var[-3])

# Often, when dealing with iterators, we also need to keep a count of iterations. Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task. The enumerate () method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in the form of an enumerating object. This enumerated object can then be used directly for loops or converted into a list of tuples using the list() function.

#Syntax: enumerate(iterable, start=0)

# Parameters:

# Iterable: any object that supports iteration
# Start: the index value from which the counter is to be started, by default it is 0
# Return: Returns an iterator with index and element pairs from the original iterable

print("max is",max(tup))
# Syntax : max(arg1, arg2, *args[, key]) 

# Parameters :

# *args : multiple objects
# key : function where comparison of iterable is performed based on its return value
# Returns : The maximum value
